Execution instructions:

1.Import the project as Mavenproject to eclipse
2.Go to runner class under /src/test/java/Runner/Runner.java  and run as Junit
3.After execution, reports folder will be created and open the serenity html report to check the status of the report(Have attached the report file in the mail as well)


Additional info:

1.Created 2 scenarios as per the requirement with BDD and JAVA.
2.Have used Cucumber JVM,Webdriver and Maven.
3.Also added serenity plugin to get the better report view.
4.Uploaded files in github repository.
5.The given user credentials is not working. So created new username.

Further improvements to develop framework:

1.Serenity report can be enhanced.
2.We can integrate the project with Jenkins and execute testcases from the Jenkins job instead of executing through eclipse.So that anyone can execute the script from their end.
